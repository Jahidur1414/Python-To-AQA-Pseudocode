# Python-To-AQA-Pseudocode
A simple hashed together converter written in python for converting python programs to AQA Computer Science Pseudocode recommended syntax.

This was written initially for my own program so some parts may not work, please feel free to fork and make changes (and create pull requests)   

It is very far from perfect but will work for simple to medium complexity programs   

The program is written in python 2.7 but can just as easily convert python 3 programs   

The initial Pseudocode spec can be found here http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/AQA-GCSE-COMPSCI-W-TRB-PSEU.PDF   


How to use
-----------

Grab a copy of python-pseudocoder.py   
Open the file in a text editor and locate    
**pythonFile = "test.py"**   
Modify test.py to the full path of your python file you want to convert.   
Then run python-pseudocoder.py   
To run, you can hit run in IDLE or you can open a terminal, cd to the directory and run   
```python python-pseudocoder.py```
